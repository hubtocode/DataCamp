Which ARMA Model is Best?
Recall from Chapter 3 that the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) can be used to compare models with different numbers of parameters. It measures goodness-of-fit, but places a penalty on models with more parameters to discourage overfitting. Lower AIC scores are better.
Fit the temperature data to an AR(1), AR(2), and ARMA(1,1) and see which model is the best fit, using the AIC criterion. The AR(2) and ARMA(1,1) models have one more parameter than the AR(1) has.
The annual change in temperature is in a DataFrameÂ chg_temp.

For each ARMA model, create an instance of the ARMA class called mod using the argument order=(p,q)
Fit the model mod using the method fit() and save it in a results object called res
Print the AIC value, found in res.aic

# Import the module for estimating an ARMA model
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA

# Fit the data to an AR(1) model and print AIC:
mod_ar1 = ARMA(chg_temp, order=(1, 0))
res_ar1 = mod_ar1.fit()
print("The AIC for an AR(1) is: ", res_ar1.aic)

# Fit the data to an AR(2) model and print AIC:
mod_ar2 = ARMA(chg_temp, order=(2, 0))
res_ar2 = mod_ar2.fit()
print("The AIC for an AR(2) is: ", res_ar2.aic)

# Fit the data to an ARMA(1,1) model and print AIC:
mod_arma11 = ARMA(chg_temp, order=(1, 1))
res_arma11 = mod_arma11.fit()
print("The AIC for an ARMA(1,1) is: ", res_arma11.aic)
